# D&D 5e Point-Buy Calculator

A point-buy calculator for **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition** (D&D 5e) that helps generate character ability scores with race-specific bonuses and variant handling. Built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, this web application dynamically calculates point costs for ability scores and applies racial modifiers based on the selected race or variant.

## Features

### Ability Score Calculator

- Allows users to manually adjust their characterâ€™s **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma** scores.
- Automatically calculates and displays the point costs for each ability score based on D&D 5e point buy rules.

### Racial Modifiers

- **Dynamic racial modifiers** are applied when a user selects a race from the dropdown.
- The app includes all standard D&D 5e races such as **Dragonborn**, **Elf**, **Dwarf**, **Tiefling**, and **Human**.
- Variant races are also supported, such as **High Elf**, **Hill Dwarf**, and **Variant Human**.
- **Example**: Selecting **Dragonborn** automatically applies +2 to Strength and +1 to Charisma, updating the total character ability scores and point costs.

### Custom Attribute Selection for Certain Races

- Races like **Half-Elf**, **Variant Human**, and **Changeling** allow users to pick additional attribute bonuses.
- For example, **Variant Human** lets you choose two ability scores to increase by +1, reflecting D&D 5e custom attributes rules.

### Variant Race Support

- Several races, including **Dwarves**, **Elves**, **Gnomes**, **Genasi**, and **Shifters**, include variants with their own unique bonuses.
- **Example**: Selecting **Hill Dwarf** grants +2 Constitution and +1 Wisdom, while selecting **Mountain Dwarf** grants +2 Strength and +2 Constitution.

### Live Modifier and Total Score Calculation

- The app dynamically updates the total ability scores and modifiers as users adjust their base ability scores or racial bonuses.
- Modifiers for each ability score are calculated in real time based on the D&D 5e rules (e.g., a score of 14 provides a +2 modifier).
  
### Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS

- The app uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, offering a clean and responsive design across different screen sizes.
- A custom color palette is applied for a D&D look and feel.

### Global State Management with React Context API

- Uses **React Context API** for managing global state, such as the currently selected race, attribute scores, and racial bonuses.
- Ensures smooth updates across components without needing page reloads.
